        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm Nkosinathi Khumalo, a Computer Science student from Sekhukhune,Limpopo.
            When i was growing up i was always fascinated by the technology we use daily such as mobile devices and its applications, my curiosity led me to finding the reason
        behind this and i found a term called 'coding' and that is where my interest in coding stems from. </p>
        <p>I am a student with a strong interest in building practical and user-centered
            software solutions. I enjoy working across both frontend and backend development, with an additional experience in graphic and UI/UX design.
        </p>
        <p>I am motiated by learning new technologies, improving my craft, and using technology to address real world challenges.
            Through academic projects,personal projects and leadership roles, I have developed strong problem solving skills and a collaborative approach to development.
